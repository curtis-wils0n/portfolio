## Curtis Wilson - Web Developer based in Calgary, Alberta 

**Hello!** My name is Curtis (he/him), I'm a web developer currently living in Calgary (Mohk√≠nstsis) while working on some exciting projects with [Atrema Technologies](https://www.atrematech.com/).

After a few years in the non-profit and education/facilitation world, I decided to make the dive into what I fell in love with during university: coding. Since then I've had the pleasure to work with high-profile clients like [Caterpillar](https://www.caterpillar.com/) to deliver top-of-the-line diagnostics applications that are used today around the globe. 

## Skills and Expertise

As demonstrated by my [projects](/projects), I try to keep myself busy with both the front-end and back-end of applications. Especially this early on in my journey I believe it's important to learn wherever I can, stay flexible, and keep myself open to new experiences. You have to practice full-stack if you want to be full-stack!

Front-end wise, I've done quite a bit of work with **Angular** and **React**. I'm particularly drawn to the state-based structure that Angular provides with RxJS and NgRx and have worked on large-scale applications using this framework.

For the back-end, most of my experience is in **.NET**, whether it's an API backed up by RabbitMQ or supporting a web app built in Blazor. From webforms to web apps, I've grown to appreciate .NET's versatility.

## Lifelong Learning

From 2016-2021 I attended the University of Calgary and received a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations. In my third year I was required as an arts student to take at least two sciences courses to receive my degree, and decided that I would try a class in computer science. I had grown up tinkering with modding video games on my family desktop and was always curious about programming, so I took the dive and enrolled myself in CPSC217 (Introduction to Computer Science for Multidisciplinary Studies I) where we were taught Python3. I was hooked. I was never phenomenal at school, and I was so uncharacteristically enthusiastic about assignments and projects that I knew I'd have to take more courses. By the end of my degree I had taken two courses short of having a minor in compsci.

Unfortunately, I was already nearing the end of my degree and had already paid for three years of tuition towards my Bachelor of Arts, so I decided to finish of that degree and focus on the implications of technology and cybersecurity in international relations for my capstone paper. Maybe programming would be a hobby I could do on my time off.

Years later, in the middle of the pandemic, I was working as a sex-ed facilitator in various highschools around Calgary and decided to move on from my job. I was accepted to the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) for a two-year program in software development, but the idea of two more years of school after my five-year degree was daunting. I would always chat with a friend of mine who works for [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) about my various side projects and interest in coding, and out of the blue she recommended a coding bootcamp her cousin had attended a few years earlier. Three months was far more realistic than two years.

My short time at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) was an incredible experience and came at a very opportune point in my life. After just three months I was trained up and sitting down for interviews at tech companies around Calgary, and only about a month after graduating I landed a job with Atrema Technologies, my current employer.

That experience over those few years solidified my committment to learning and challenging myself wherever possible, whether that is on the job or in side projects and hobbies. I would have never imagined being where I am today if it weren't for taking those risks, and I hope to share that excitement and all those learnings with likeminded individuals I come across!
