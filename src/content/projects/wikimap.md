Created with [Kevin Lee](https://github.com/jhssttj) for Lighthouse Labs' full-time web development bootcamp midterm project.

**Project Overview:**

_WikiMap_ is a bold, easy-to-use social map-making application that allows users to create, edit, and share custom maps with friends. 

## Objectives

1. Create a minimalist application that places focus on the user's interaction with the map and its markers.
2. Maintain a persistent database for users to see maps created by others.
3. Allow users to search seamlessly using the Google Maps API.

## Features

1. **I Can Show You the World:**

- Access a list of diverse and creative maps created by users around the globe.
- Easily browse maps based on user-submitted titles and descriptions.

2. **I Know a Spot:**

- Collaborate with other users on any map by suggesting places based on their map's theme!
- Favourite any map for future reference.

- Include images, descriptions, and tips for anyone viewing your map in the future.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Sass and jQuery for displaying content to users, Ajax for asynchronous updates with user data.
- Backend: Node and Express for a robust, scalable architecture.
- Database: PostgreSQL to handle updates from users around the world.

## Outcome

_WikiMap_ was a great first project during my time at Lighthouse Labs, and Kevin was a fantastic partner to develop with. We had yet to learn a full-scale framework at this point in the course, but I am proud of what we were able to accomplish with some fairly basic tools. Integrating the Google Maps API was also an exciting challenge, and set us up for success in future projects where we were using tools from companies like Stripe.
