**Project Overview:**

_Jungle_ is a mini e-commerce proof-of-concept application built with Rails 6.1. It was originally forked as an extension of Lighthouse Labs' learning application under the same name as a way to simulate adding features to an existing codebase.

## Objectives

1. Simulate the contribution of features and bug-fixes to an in-production application.
2. Integrate Stripe functionality for payments with Stripe's test cards.
3. Implement basic user authentication and persistent item cart logic.

## Features

1. **A Storefront for Plant Vendors:**

- Admin users are able to populate Jungle with any plant of their choosing, including photos, descriptions, price and quantities remaining.
- Are you an evergreen fiend? Or maybe a bonsai guy? Group your plants into categories for quick navigation.

2. **Your One-Stop-Shop for Flora:**

- Users can browse a curated selection of plants from their favourite vendors, adding to their shopping cart as they go.
- Accounts allow users to maintain a cart of products for future use.
- Users are able to checkout with Stripe, integrated for everyone's peace of mind.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend & Backend: Ruby on Rails for scalable, component-driven pages.
- Database: Active Record for simple RoR implementation.

## Outcome

_Jungle_ proved to be an extraordinary learning experience as a newer developer, allowing me to contribute features and bug fixes in a way that mimicked an in-production application. Additionally, working with Stripe to implement a payment system introduced me to a whole suite of testing capabilities through their documentation.
